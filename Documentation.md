The main form is divided in 3 parts:

* **main menu:** you can select a TFS project here, specify an area and/or an iteration to filter displayed work items and select a template for tasks creation. The default template containing all required fields is created automatically for each project. You can add more templates in case of need.
* **left panel:** work items tree is displayed here; it can be filtered by area and/or iteration. You also can load a selected item specifying its ID.
* **right panel:** tasks template is displayed here; fields that should be the same for all new tasks are listed in the top part (e.g. State); items that should be unique for each item (e.g. Title) are listed in the grid below. The grid supports pasting data copied from Excel.

Use **Task Template -> Manage Templates** menu item to create/edit/delete tasks templates.
